        A little bit more about this project, for those interested.
      </h1>
      <p class="hero-description top-margin">
        Welcome to my first capstone project â€” this application represents the
        culmination of my educational journey at the half-way point of
        Springboard's software engineering program, where I have applied the
        concepts and techniques learned throughout the course of the program.
        This includes the basics of web development taught through
        <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
        <strong>Javascript</strong> but the project focuses most heavily on
        broadly demonstrating <strong>Python</strong> development and the suite
        of tools that we've learned alongside it.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-description closer-top">
        It is a full-stack application combining most tools I have at my
        disposal to this point. The most notable of those being the use of
        Python, the <strong>Flask</strong> backend framework,
        <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as the database management system, and
        <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> for ORM modeling. I use the Jinja templating
        engine in Flask to inject data passed from my server-side route points
        into dynamic HTML templates, and make use of
        <strong>TheMealDB API</strong> to externally fetch meal data for the
        service.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-description closer-top">
        The website design is also made with all custom CSS, and makes use of
        JavaScript and <strong>jQuery</strong> for some front-end functionality,
        such as the meal-plan builder shopping cart system - which sends
        client-side data to an API point on the Flask server to synchronize the
        local storage cache data with the user's session data, and updates the
        displayed shopping cart automatically. I was particularly proud of this
        implementation - as it was my first real application instance of
        independently tackling the complex conceptual challenge around how to
        use JavaScript front-end code in conjunction with a Python back-end by
        using event triggers that send data back into the server to be stored
        and processed for dynamically updating the page.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-description closer-top">
        Directly after this project, I begin work on the second half of the
        program, which marks the end of our time with Python and refocuses on
        full-stack development with JavaScript using
        <strong>Node.js</strong> with tools like <strong>React</strong>,
        <strong>Express</strong>, and <strong>Redux</strong>.
