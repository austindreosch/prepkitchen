# prepkitchen, a Springboard capstone project.

Welcome to my first capstone project â€” this application represents the culmination of my educational journey at the half-way point of Springboard's software engineering program. Here I have applied the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course, focusing on Python development and the suite of tools that we've learned alongside it.

## Project Overview

This full-stack application combines the skills and tools I've acquired to this point, including:
- Python
- Flask backend framework
- PostgreSQL for database management
- SQLAlchemy for ORM modeling
- Jinja templating engine
- TheMealDB API for external data fetching

The website design is also made with all custom CSS, and makes use of JavaScript and jQuery for some front-end functionality, such as the meal-plan builder shopping cart system - which sends client-side data to an API point on the Flask server to synchronize the local storage cache data with the user's session data, and updates the displayed shopping cart automatically. I was particularly proud of this implementation - as it was my first real application instance of independently tackling the complex conceptual challenge around how to use JavaScript front-end code in conjunction with a Python back-end by using event triggers that send data back into the server to be stored and processed for dynamically updating the page.
