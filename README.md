# Springboard Capstone Project 

Welcome to my first capstone project â€” this application represents the culmination of my educational journey at the half-way point of Springboard's software engineering program. Here I have applied the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course, focusing on Python development and the suite of tools that we've learned alongside it.

## Project Overview

This full-stack application combines the skills and tools I've acquired to this point, including:
- Python
- Flask backend framework
- PostgreSQL for database management
- SQLAlchemy for ORM modeling
- Jinja templating engine in Flask
- TheMealDB API for external data fetching

The website design is all custom CSS and uses JavaScript and jQuery for some front-end functionality, such as a meal-plan builder shopping cart system. This project provided a real application instance of using JavaScript front-end code in conjunction with a Python back-end by using event triggers that send data back into the server to be stored and processed for dynamically updating the page.
